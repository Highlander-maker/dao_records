# Mission Statementâ€¦

Our mission is to empower independent music and promote social causes through the power of music. As a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governed by a board of directors, we strive to support artists who are passionate about creating meaningful and impactful music that resonates with people around the world. By leveraging the transparency and security of blockchain technology, we aim to create a more equitable and accessible music industry that provides greater value to both artists and fans. Our goal is to foster a community of like-minded individuals who share our vision and are dedicated to supporting independent music and social causes. 

## But why Blockchain you ask?

**Transparency:** The blockchain provides a transparent and immutable ledger, which means that all transactions and ownership of assets (e.g. music rights) are recorded on a public ledger that cannot be altered. This can provide greater transparency for artists and fans alike, as they can track the ownership and use of their music.

**Smart Contracts:** The blockchain allows for the use of smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with the terms of the contract directly written into the code. This can streamline the management of music rights, royalties, and other contractual agreements between the label, artists, and other parties.

**NFTs:** for concert tickets: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) can be used to represent unique digital assets such as concert tickets. This can provide greater security and transparency for ticket sales, as the ownership and validity of the tickets can be recorded on the blockchain.

**Decentralized Distribution:** The blockchain can enable decentralized distribution of music, allowing artists to directly connect with their fans and distribute their music without the need for a centralized intermediary such as a traditional record label. This can lead to greater independence for artists and a more diverse and decentralized music industry.

**Fan Engagement:** The blockchain can also enable new ways for fans to engage with their favorite artists, such as through ownership of exclusive content, participation in governance decisions, and more.

**Royalty Distribution:** The blockchain can facilitate more efficient and transparent royalty distribution for artists, allowing them to receive payments directly and instantly from their fans or other revenue streams, without the need for intermediaries that can take a significant cut.

**Overall, the blockchain can provide a more transparent, efficient, and decentralized approach to managing a record label, enabling greater trust and engagement between artists, fans, and the label itself.**

## Determine the DAO's governance structure:

**Determine how the DAO will be governed:** This could include creating a board of directors or a council of members who will make decisions on behalf of the DAO. Alternatively, you could use a decentralized governance model, where decisions are made through a voting system that is open to all token holders.

- The DAO will have a board of directors consisting of 3-5 members who are elected by token holders through a voting process.
- The board of directors will have the power to make decisions on behalf of the DAO, including signing and promoting independent music, determining fundraising goals and strategies, and overseeing the allocation of funds.
- The board will meet regularly to discuss and vote on important matters, and will be responsible for ensuring the DAO is aligned with its mission and values.
- Token holders will have the right to vote on important decisions, such as the election of board members, changes to the DAO's bylaws, and major funding decisions. (NEED TO WORK ON THIS)
- A certain percentage of the tokens will be reserved for the community treasury, which will be used to fund projects and initiatives that are aligned with the DAO's mission.

**Benefits:**

- The board of directors will provide strong leadership and oversight for the DAO, ensuring that decisions are made in the best interests of the organization and its stakeholders.
- The use of token holder voting will ensure that the community has a voice in important decisions, promoting a sense of ownership and engagement among members.
- Reserving a percentage of tokens for the community treasury will ensure that the DAO has the resources it needs to fund projects and initiatives that align with its mission, without relying on external funding sources.
- The transparent and decentralized nature of the blockchain will enable greater transparency and accountability for the DAO, fostering trust and confidence among stakeholders.

## Create a token: $DARE

We will need to create a custom token for DAO Records $DARE. The token should represent ownership or governance rights in the DAO or provide access to exclusive content or experiences related to the label and its artists. By creating a custom token for record label DAO records, we can leverage the benefits of blockchain technology to build a strong and engaged community around your artists and promote transparency and accountability in the music industry.

**Token Type and Standard:** Choose a token type and standard that suits your needs and use case, such as cw20, or Token Factory $DARE. This will determine the technical specifications of your token and how it can be used and traded on various platforms.

**Token Distribution:** Determine the total supply of tokens and how they will be distributed, such as through a public sale, private sale, or airdrop to early supporters. This will determine the initial distribution of ownership and governance rights in the DAO.

**Token Utility:** Determine the utility of the token, such as its use in governance, access to exclusive content or experiences, and rewards and incentives for artists and fans. This will determine the demand and value of the token over time.

**Token Economics:** Determine the token economics, such as the inflation rate, burn rate, and token buyback programs, to ensure the long-term sustainability and growth of the token and the DAO.

## Establish fundraising mechanisms:

Will have to decide how the DAO will raise funds. This could include selling tokens to investors or fans through an initial coin offering (ICO) or other crowdfunding mechanisms. Alternatively, the DAO could generate revenue through other means such as merchandise sales or ticket sales.

**Decide on fundraising goals and strategies:** Determine how much funding we need to achieve our mission and objectives, and what strategies you will use to raise funds. This could include selling tokens to investors or fans through an ICO, a decentralized crowdfunding platform, or a traditional fundraising campaign. (LOOK IN TO STREAMSWAP)

**Develop a marketing and communications plan:** To attract investors or fans to participate in our fundraising campaign, develop a clear and compelling marketing and communications plan that highlights the benefits of our DAO and $DARE token, and how they align with our mission and values.

**Set up a secure and compliant fundraising platform:** Depending on the fundraising strategy we choose, we will need to set up a secure and compliant fundraising platform that meets the legal and regulatory requirements of your jurisdiction and ensures the safety and privacy of your investors or fans.

**Launch the fundraising campaign:** Once we have developed our marketing and communications plan and set up our fundraising platform, launch our fundraising campaign and promote it through various channels such as social media, email, and PR.

### **Benefits of raising funds:**

**Access to capital:**  By raising funds through a fundraising campaign, DAO Records can access capital to achieve its mission and objectives, such as signing and promoting new independent artists, hosting concerts and events, and developing new music products and services.

**Community engagement:** A fundraising campaign can help build a strong and engaged community around DAO Records, as investors or fans who participate in the campaign become stakeholders and advocates for our mission and values.

**Brand awareness and exposure:** A successful fundraising campaign can generate buzz and publicity for the DAO, helping to increase brand awareness and exposure for Dao Records and its artists.

**Transparency and accountability:** By leveraging blockchain technology, our fundraising campaign can promote transparency and accountability in the music industry, as investors or fans can track the use of funds and the performance of the DAO in real-time.

**Incentives for investors or fans:** Depending on the fundraising strategy we choose, our investors or fans may receive incentives such as exclusive access to music products and services, discounted concert tickets, and token-based loyalty programs. This can help build loyalty and engagement with your community, driving growth and success for DAO Records and its artists.

## Sign and promote artists:

Once DAO Records has sufficient funding, it can begin to sign and promote artists. The DAO's governance structure should be used to make decisions on which artists to sign and which projects to fund.

**Identify and scout new talent:** Use various channels such as social media, live music events, shows that i work on and artists that i work with as an engineer in the industry, use my 10 years experience in networking with artists and clients on shows. Patch in to music industry networks to identify and scout new independent artists who align with our mission and values. We will consider factors such as the artist's musical style, fan base, social impact, and potential for growth and commercial success. 

**Offer recording services:** Once we have identified promising artists,  we can offer them recording services and facilities to produce high-quality and professional recordings that showcase their talent and potential. As a DAO-run label, we can offer competitive rates and flexible contracts that prioritize the artist's creative control and financial compensation via the use of Blockchain Technology. 

**Promote artists and their music:** Once we have recorded and produced the artists' material, promote it through various channels such as online streaming platforms, social media, and music industry events. Use our DAO's marketing and communications plan to build buzz and excitement around the artists' music and message, and engage with fans and supporters through interactive campaigns and contests.

**Foster collaboration and community:** To build a strong and supportive music community in Manchester and eventually the world, collaborate with local music industry stakeholders such as event organizers, music venues, and media outlets. Host networking events and workshops that bring together artists, fans, and industry experts to share knowledge and expertise, and foster a culture of innovation and creativity in the music industry and the use game changing tech like Blockchain.
